## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```

   Open browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/` to see the expo app.

3. Run the tests

   ```bash
    npm test
   ```

   **Note:** I made a recent commit to the main `_layout` component:

   ```
   Because an issue with showing the Demo using Expo App in my Phone
   I decided to bring back default config from Expo template using the useEffect.
   Also removed the Dropdown Library I was using because it was making issues.
   Sadly didnt had the time to add the Dropdown :(
   ```

   Por cierto, hablo Espa√±ol. No se porque decidi escribir todo lo anterior y los commits en ingles :)
